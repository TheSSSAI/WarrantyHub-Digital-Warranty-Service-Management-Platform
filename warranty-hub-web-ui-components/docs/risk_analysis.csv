"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Mobile OS background task aggression (iOS/Android) may kill the technician location tracking service, causing gaps in GPS history and real-time visibility failure.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-MOB-002, WI-BE-007","Modern mobile operating systems aggressively terminate background processes to conserve battery, specifically affecting long-running geolocation services.","Implement foreground service notifications for Android and 'Always' location permissions for iOS; implement local buffering of coordinates when the socket disconnects; utilize 'significant change' location services as a fallback trigger.","Fallback to a 'Check-In/Check-Out' manual location update model if continuous tracking proves unreliable on specific OEM Android devices.","Gap in GPS coordinate timestamps exceeding 5 minutes for active technicians in 'Travel Mode'.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-TECH-002","Technical","High-frequency GPS write volume (TimescaleDB) combined with WebSocket broadcasting may saturate database I/O and introduce latency exceeding the <2s requirement.","4","4","16","High","WI-BE-007, WI-INFRA-002","Writing every single GPS coordinate update directly to disk creates immense I/O pressure; standard relational writes cannot sustain high-throughput telemetry.","Implement an ephemeral buffering layer (Redis) for real-time 'current location' reads; perform batch asynchronous writes to TimescaleDB for historical trace data only.","Scale up the TimescaleDB instance SKU or reduce the default GPS polling frequency from 5s to 15s.","WebSocket message latency exceeding 500ms or Database Write Queue depth > 1000 items.","Backend Architect","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-EXT-001","External","Azure AD B2C token synchronization issues with the local user database may cause authentication loops or stale role data, breaking RBAC.","4","4","16","High","WI-BE-001, WI-FE-001","Decoupling identity management (B2C) from authorization logic (local PG database) introduces eventual consistency challenges and token claim mapping errors.","Implement a custom B2C API Connector to push user updates to the local database via webhooks during the token issuance flow; enforce short JWT expiration times.","Implement a forced 're-login' flow if the local user record version does not match the token version.","Increase in HTTP 403 Forbidden errors for valid tokens in Application Insights.","Security Lead","2025-06-20","In Progress"
"RISK-QUAL-001","Quality","Offline-first data synchronization (WatermelonDB) may result in data conflicts or corruption when multiple device states reconcile with the server.","3","5","15","High","WI-MOB-001, WI-BE-002","Bi-directional sync logic is complex; identifying the 'source of truth' when a user modifies data offline while the server state changes is error-prone.","Define strict 'Server Wins' conflict resolution policies for reference data; use append-only event logs for transactional data (e.g., Service Requests) to avoid update conflicts.","Disable offline write capabilities for critical entities and revert to 'Read-Only' offline mode.","Sync error rate > 2% in client telemetry.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-OPS-001","Operational","Failure to meet the <15 minute RPO target for PostgreSQL due to misconfigured Geo-Redundancy or Write-Ahead Log (WAL) lag.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-INFRA-002","Default Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server configurations may not automatically guarantee 15-minute RPO across regions without specific tuning of checkpointing and replication.","Configure Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Geo-Redundant backups and verify WAL replication latency metrics; implement automated PITR testing.","Failover to the read-replica immediately (promote to primary) accepting potential minor data loss if primary region is fully irretrievable.","Replication lag metric > 500MB or > 60 seconds.","DevOps Engineer","2025-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-TECH-003","Technical","Mapbox API integration may exceed budget or rate limits due to inefficient tile caching or excessive geocoding requests from the Super Admin dashboard.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-FE-001, WI-BE-003","Interactive polygon drawing tools and technician tracking maps generate high volumes of tile and geocoding requests if not properly cached.","Implement aggressive client-side tile caching; proxy geocoding requests through a backend service with rate limiting and response caching (Redis).","Switch to Azure Maps or OpenStreetMap for non-critical map layers if Mapbox costs become unsustainable.","Mapbox API usage reaching 80% of monthly budget tier within the first 15 days.","Frontend Lead","2025-07-10","Not Started"

"TC-CORE-001","Geospatial Routing Engine","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","Very High","Verify Service Request is automatically routed to the correct Service Center based on User Location falling within a defined Service Area Polygon.","Critical - Incorrect routing causes service delays and contractual violations.","High - Involves PostGIS ST_Contains queries and brand authorization checks.","Service Center A exists with defined Polygon P1 and Brand B authorization. User address geocodes to Point L inside P1.","1. User submits Service Request for Product (Brand B) with location L. 2. System triggers routing logic. 3. System queries PostGIS for polygons containing L linked to Brand B.","Service Request is assigned to Service Center A.

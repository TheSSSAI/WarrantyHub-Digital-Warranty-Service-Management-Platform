"RISK-001","Technical","SignalR connection instability and latency exceeding the <2s requirement for real-time technician tracking under high concurrency (10,000 users), leading to poor user experience and SLA breaches.","4","5","20","High","WI-NET-001, WI-MOB-001, EPIC-REALTIME","Mobile network volatility combined with potential socket exhaustion on the backend if Azure SignalR Service is not correctly scaled or configured with a Redis backplane.","Implement Azure SignalR Service with 'Default' service mode for auto-scaling. Configure Redis backplane for multi-instance synchronization. Implement client-side location interpolation to smooth movement visuals during packet loss.","Fallback to polling mechanism (every 5-10s) via standard REST API if WebSocket connection cannot be established or maintained.","SignalR connection drop rate > 5% or E2E message latency > 1.5s for 5 consecutive minutes.","Lead .NET Architect","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Performance","PostGIS spatial queries for service center routing (ST_Contains on complex polygons) causing high CPU load and latency spikes on the primary database during peak registration times.","3","5","15","High","WI-BE-003, WI-INFRA-002, WI-FE-001","Complex geofenced polygons with excessive vertices combined with synchronous processing of service requests on the main transactional database node.","Enforce vertex limits on polygons in UI. Implement GiST spatial indexing on the database. Offload read-heavy spatial queries to PostgreSQL read replicas.","Implement a simplified bounding box check as a primary filter before executing precise polygon queries to reduce computational load.","Database CPU utilization > 80% or Service Request creation latency > 400ms.","Lead Backend Engineer (NestJS)","2025-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Technician mobile app background location services being killed by aggressive Android/iOS battery optimizations, resulting in gaps in tracking data and inaccurate ETAs.","5","4","20","Critical","WI-MOB-001, WI-NET-002","Native OS restrictions on background processes and lack of 'foreground service' configuration or motion-activity recognition integration.","Implement 'react-native-background-geolocation' with motion-change detection (stop GPS when stationary). Configure visible Foreground Service notifications for Android.","Implement local buffering of coordinates on the device to be batch-uploaded when the app resumes into the foreground.","Gaps in location history timestamps exceeding 5 minutes for active technicians.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-20","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Operational","Offline data synchronization conflicts in the Technician App leading to data loss or corruption when multiple updates occur to the same service ticket from different sources.","4","4","16","High","WI-MOB-003, WS-MOB-TECH","Lack of a robust conflict resolution strategy in the 'Offline-First' architecture (WatermelonDB/Realm) when syncing queued actions with the backend.","Implement a 'Last-Write-Wins' policy for simple fields and a specialized merge logic for status transitions. Use optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities on sync failure.","Force manual user resolution (UI prompt) when a server-side conflict is detected that cannot be auto-resolved.","Sync error rate > 1% of total sync attempts via Application Insights.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Security","Azure AD B2C integration complexity leads to improper token validation or role mapping, potentially allowing unauthorized access to cross-tenant data (e.g., Brand Admin accessing another Brand's data).","2","5","10","Medium","WI-BE-001, WI-NET-001, WS-FE-ADMIN","Misconfiguration of Custom Policies in B2C or improper validation of JWT claims (aud, iss, roles) in the backend guards/middleware.","Implement comprehensive integration tests for RBAC. Use standardized JWT validation middleware across both NestJS and .NET services. Enforce strict claim checks.","Engage Microsoft Identity support specialist for architectural review. Revert to standard User Flows if Custom Policies prove too unstable.","401/403 Error spikes in API Gateway logs or detection of token signature validation failures.","Security Architect","2025-05-30","Monitoring"
"RISK-006","External","Cost overruns and service throttling from Mapbox API usage due to excessive rendering of map tiles or geocoding requests.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-FE-001, WS-FE-ADMIN","Inefficient client-side caching of map tiles or unnecessary re-geocoding of addresses that haven't changed.","Cache geocoding results in the backend database. Use vector tiles for efficient rendering. Set strict quotas and budget alerts in the Mapbox console.","Switch to Azure Maps as a fallback provider if Mapbox costs become unsustainable or limits are reached.","Mapbox API usage reaching 80% of monthly budget within the first 15 days.","Product Owner","2025-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","Integration delays between the .NET OCR Worker service and the Azure AI Document Intelligence API due to model accuracy issues requiring extensive tuning.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-BG-001, WS-BG-OCR","Standard pre-built models may not accurately parse diverse invoice formats, requiring custom model training which is time-intensive.","Start testing with pre-built models immediately (Shift Left). Implement a 'Human-in-the-loop' fallback UI where admins can correct OCR confidence failures.","Reduce scope to only support specific high-volume invoice templates for MVP release.","OCR extraction confidence scores averaging < 85% during initial testing.","Lead .NET Developer","2025-06-05","Not Started"

"RISK-001","Technical","Azure AD B2C custom policy configuration complexity may block authentication implementation for multiple personas (Technician, Admin, User), delaying the entire project start.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-BE-001, US-016, US-096, US-060, US-085","High complexity of XML-based custom policies in Azure AD B2C required for multi-role RBAC and MFA integration.","Assign Senior Identity Specialist immediately to configure base policies. Utilize Azure AD B2C Starter Pack. Implement 'mock' authentication provider for local dev to unblock feature development while B2C is configured.","Fallback to standard User Flows with reduced customization if Custom Policies prove too unstable or time-consuming, sacrificing some UX customization.","Authentication setup incomplete by Sprint 2.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Mobile offline synchronization queue (WatermelonDB/Realm) may experience data conflicts or loss during bi-directional sync when network connectivity is intermittent.","4","5","20","High","WI-MOB-001, US-075, US-082, US-056","Complex state management required to handle 'First-In-First-Out' queue processing and server-side validation errors for actions performed days ago.","Implement 'Command Pattern' for offline actions. Treat server state as the single source of truth. Develop comprehensive unit tests for the sync engine simulating poor network conditions.","Implement 'Manual Sync Resolution' UI where technicians must manually resolve conflicts if automated sync fails.","Sync error rate > 5% in beta testing.","Senior Mobile Developer","2025-03-01","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Operational","Technician background location tracking may be killed by iOS/Android OS battery optimizations, causing failure of the Real-Time Tracking feature.","5","4","20","High","WI-MOB-003, US-079, US-072","Aggressive battery saving protocols in modern mobile operating systems that terminate long-running background processes.","Utilize a battle-tested dedicated library (e.g., react-native-background-geolocation). Configure 'Heartbeat' mechanism. Implement visual indicators in-app to warn technicians if background location is disabled.","Implement push notification 'pings' to wake up the app if location data becomes stale.","Gaps in location history > 5 minutes during active travel mode.","Mobile Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Performance","PostGIS spatial queries for service center routing may degrade in performance as the dataset of service areas (polygons) grows, violating the <250ms latency SLA.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-BE-005, US-098, US-013","Complex 'ST_Contains' or 'ST_Intersects' queries against complex polygons without proper spatial indexing.","Implement spatial indexing (GIST) on the geometry column. Cache routing results in Redis for frequently queried postal codes. Simplify complex polygons using ST_Simplify before storage.","Scale up Azure Database for PostgreSQL SKU or offload read queries to a read-replica.","Routing API latency exceeds 200ms in load testing.","Database Administrator","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","Azure AI Document Intelligence (OCR) variability may lead to high manual correction rates for invoices, degrading user experience.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-MOB-002, US-018, US-020","Variability in invoice formats, lighting conditions, and image quality uploaded by users.","Implement client-side image optimization (cropping/contrast enhancement) before upload. Provide immediate UI feedback for low-confidence scans prompting manual entry.","Allow completely manual entry fallback (US-020) and flag poor OCR performance for model retraining.","OCR Confidence Score < 70% on > 20% of uploads.","Product Owner","2025-02-20","Monitoring"
"RISK-006","Timeline","Strict WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirement across three different portals (Web, iOS, Android) may cause development velocity to drop significantly.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-WEB-001, All Frontend Stories","Retrofitting accessibility is time-consuming; React Native accessibility primitives differ from Web.","Integrate 'axe-core' into CI/CD pipeline immediately. Enforce accessibility checks in Pull Requests. Use a pre-validated UI component library.","Hire external accessibility accessibility audit firm to identify critical blocks parallel to development.","Accessibility automated scan failure rate > 0.","Frontend Lead","2025-02-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","WebSocket connection limits on Azure App Service/AKS ingress may bottleneck during peak hours, violating the <2s real-time latency requirement.","3","5","15","High","WI-BE-004, US-041, US-097","Stateful nature of WebSockets makes autoscaling harder compared to stateless REST APIs.","Use Azure SignalR Service or Redis Adapter for Socket.io to offload connection management state. Implement aggressive horizontal scaling rules based on active socket count.","Fallback to short-polling for location updates if socket connection fails.","Socket connection count > 80% of node capacity.","DevOps Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"

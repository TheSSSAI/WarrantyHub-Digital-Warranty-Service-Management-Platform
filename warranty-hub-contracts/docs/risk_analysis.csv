"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Mobile Operating Systems (iOS/Android) frequently kill background processes for battery optimization, threatening the reliability of the Technician 'Travel Mode' location tracking feature which requires continuous updates.","5","4","20","Critical","WI-MOB-002, WS-RN-FEATURES","Aggressive native OS battery optimization strategies and strict background permission policies in modern Android and iOS versions.","Implement a 'heartbeat' mechanism and utilize foreground services/persistent notifications for Android. For iOS, configure 'Always' location permissions and significant change location services. Use a robust native module wrapper (e.g., react-native-background-geolocation) rather than building from scratch.","Implement a fallback mechanism where the app prompts the technician to reopen the app if background tracking ceases, utilizing push notifications to wake the device/user.","Gap in GPS coordinate timestamps exceeding 5 minutes for an active 'Travel Mode' session in telemetry logs.","Mobile Tech Lead","2023-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-DATA-002","Technical","Offline data synchronization conflicts occurring when a Technician modifies job status offline (WatermelonDB) while a Service Center Admin modifies the same ticket online, leading to data inconsistency.","4","4","16","High","WI-MOB-001, WS-RN-CORE","Dual-write scenarios in a distributed system with disconnected mobile clients relying on local SQLite/WatermelonDB storage.","Design a specific 'Conflict Resolution Strategy' (e.g., Field-level Last-Write-Wins or server-side merging logic) within the SyncManager. Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities.","Force a manual resolution workflow in the Admin Portal if the system detects unresolvable version conflicts during sync.","Sync error rate metric > 1% in Application Insights for the mobile synchronization endpoint.","Backend Architect","2023-11-30","In Progress"
"RISK-PERF-003","Technical","PostGIS spatial queries for Service Center routing may degrade in performance as the number of polygons and service requests scales, breaching the <200ms latency requirement.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-BE-002, WI-INFRA-002","Complex geometric calculations (ST_Contains/ST_Intersects) on unoptimized indexes or large datasets.","Enforce GIST indexing on all geometry columns. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed Service Areas. Offload heavy read operations to PostgreSQL Read Replicas.","Simplify polygon geometries (reduce vertices) or fallback to a simpler radius-based or postal-code lookup if latency spikes.","P95 latency for '/routing/match' endpoint exceeding 150ms in performance tests.","Database Administrator","2023-12-10","Not Started"
"RISK-EXT-004","External","Azure AD B2C custom policy configuration complexity may delay the implementation of RBAC and specific user flows (Technician vs Consumer), impacting the auth timeline.","4","5","20","Critical","WI-BE-001, WS-AUTH","Azure AD B2C custom policies (Identity Experience Framework) have a steep learning curve and are XML-based, making debugging and implementation time-consuming.","Assign a senior engineer with specific Identity/B2C experience. Prototype the token claims structure immediately. Use 'User Flows' where possible before resorting to 'Custom Policies'.","Temporarily implement a local auth service for development velocity while the B2C integration is finalized in parallel.","Authentication sprint tasks incomplete by end of Sprint 1.","Security Architect","2023-11-01","In Progress"
"RISK-OPS-005","Operational","Distributed transaction failures across microservices (e.g., Service Request creation requiring User, Product, and Notification updates) may leave the system in an inconsistent state.","3","5","15","High","WI-BE-003, WS-SRVC","Microservices architecture lacking a robust distributed transaction coordinator or Saga pattern implementation.","Implement the Saga Pattern using BullMQ for compensating transactions. Ensure all event consumers are idempotent to handle message redelivery safely.","Develop a reconciliation script/job that runs nightly to identify and fix orphaned or inconsistent records across services.","Alerts on Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) depth > 0 in Azure Service Bus.","Backend Lead","2023-12-01","Not Started"
"RISK-QLTY-006","Quality","WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance may be missed in complex interactive components (e.g., Mapbox integration), leading to rework and compliance violations.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-FE-001, WS-FRONTEND-CORE","Canvas-based map libraries (Mapbox GL JS) are notoriously difficult to make fully keyboard and screen-reader accessible.","Build a sidebar or list view alternative for map data interaction. Integrate 'axe-core' into the CI/CD pipeline (WI-OPS-001) for automated accessibility linting.","Engage an external accessibility audit vendor early in the design phase to validate the map interaction patterns.","Axe linter reporting 'Critical' or 'Serious' violations in the nightly build.","Frontend Lead","2023-11-20","Not Started"

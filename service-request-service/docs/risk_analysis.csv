"RISK-001","Technical","Mobile OS battery optimization protocols (iOS/Android) aggressively terminating background location services, causing failure of the 'Travel Mode' tracking feature (WI-MOB-TECH-002) and violating the <2s latency requirement.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-MOB-TECH-002, WI-RT-002, WI-MOB-USER-002","Native operating system battery saving heuristics killing long-running background threads.","Implement platform-specific native modules (e.g., foreground services on Android, significant location change service on iOS) with 'Always On' permission requests; Implement heartbeat mechanism to detect termination.","Fallback to lower-frequency 'ping' updates via silent push notifications (FCM) to wake the app instead of persistent WebSocket streams.","Technician location update gaps exceeding 60 seconds in production telemetry.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Azure AD B2C Custom Policy complexity and XML configuration errors leading to authentication failures, token claim inaccuracies, or delays in implementing MFA and account lockout logic (WI-AUTH-001).","4","5","20","Critical","WI-AUTH-001, WI-AUTH-002, WI-WEB-001, WI-MOB-TECH-001","High complexity of Identity Experience Framework (IEF) XML and lack of local debugging tools for B2C.","Allocate a dedicated Identity Specialist; Implement automated B2C policy upload/validation in CI/CD; Create a standalone 'Identity Lab' tenant for isolated policy testing.","Revert to standard User Flows with reduced customization if Custom Policies prove too unstable for launch, deferring custom lockout logic.","Authentication failure rate > 1% or reported login loop issues during QA.","Security Architect","2025-06-01","In Progress"

"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Mobile OS battery optimization strategies (iOS/Android) aggressively killing background location tracking processes required for 'Travel Mode', causing gaps in technician tracking data and SLA breaches.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-SERV-002 (Implement Background Location Tracking)","Native OS limitations on background execution to preserve battery life, conflicting with the requirement for <2s latency real-time tracking.","Implement foreground service notifications for Android and 'Always Allow' location permission flows for iOS. utilize specialized libraries like `react-native-background-geolocation` that handle motion-detection state changes to reduce battery drain while maintaining accuracy.","Implement 'heartbeat' logic where the backend sends silent push notifications to wake up the app if location data stops streaming during an active job.","Gap in GPS coordinate timestamps exceeding 30 seconds for any technician in 'Travel Mode'.","Mobile Lead Developer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-TECH-002","Technical","Data synchronization conflicts and data loss in the offline-first mobile architecture when reconciling local WatermelonDB/SQLite data with the backend after prolonged offline periods.","4","4","16","High","WI-PROD-004 (Develop Offline Product List & Warranty Card)","Complexity in bidirectional sync logic when multiple entities (e.g., technician and admin) modify the same service request state simultaneously.","Implement 'Last-Write-Wins' strategy for simple fields and an append-only event log pattern for critical state changes. Design API endpoints to accept batched sync payloads with idempotency keys.","Develop a conflict resolution UI on the mobile app to prompt the technician to manually resolve data discrepancies if auto-merge fails.","Sync error rate exceeding 1% in Application Insights logs.","Backend Architect","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-EXT-001","External","Azure AD B2C custom policy complexity leading to token validation failures, session management issues, or inability to support required role-based claims for RBAC.","4","5","20","Critical","WI-AUTH-001, WI-AUTH-002, WI-AUTH-003","Steep learning curve of Azure AD B2C Identity Experience Framework (IEF) and potential mismatch between B2C token structure and NestJS Passport strategy requirements.","Conduct an immediate technical spike (PoC) to validate the end-to-end flow: B2C Custom Policy -> Token Issue -> React Native MSAL -> NestJS Passport Validation -> Role Extraction.","Fallback to standard User Flows if Custom Policies prove too unstable, potentially sacrificing some UI customization or complex claim augmentation.","Authentication failure rate > 5% during dev integration testing.","Security Engineer","2025-02-10","In Progress"
"RISK-PERF-001","Technical","Geospatial query performance degradation in PostgreSQL/PostGIS as the dataset grows, causing latency spikes in the Service Request Routing logic.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-SERV-001 (Implement Service Request Routing Logic)","Complex 'Point-in-Polygon' queries on unindexed or poorly indexed geometry columns combined with high concurrency during peak service request times.","Implement rigorous spatial indexing (GiST) on geometry columns. Use read replicas for routing queries. Cache service center coverage polygons in Redis for rapid pre-filtering.","Simplify routing logic to zip-code matching first, falling back to precise polygon matching only if zip codes are ambiguous.","Database CPU usage > 70% or query execution time > 100ms for routing endpoints.","Database Administrator","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-OPS-001","Operational","Terraform state file corruption or locking issues in a team environment leading to infrastructure drift and deployment blockages.","3","5","15","High","WS-IAC (Infrastructure as Code)","Multiple developers modifying infrastructure simultaneously without strict state locking mechanisms or modular separation.","Enforce remote state storage in Azure Blob Storage with lease locking enabled. Implement Terraform automation strictly through CI/CD pipelines (Atlantis or GitHub Actions) rather than local execution.","Maintain automated daily backups of the Terraform state file. Document manual state unlocking and recovery procedures.","Terraform 'lock' errors in CI/CD pipelines.","DevOps Engineer","2025-02-01","Implemented"
"RISK-QUAL-001","Quality","Inability to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for dynamic map interfaces and real-time chat components, leading to compliance violations.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-SERV-002, WI-COMM-001","Inherent difficulty in making canvas-based maps and rapidly updating WebSocket content accessible to screen readers.","Implement ARIA live regions for chat updates. Provide text-based alternatives/summaries for map data (e.g., 'Technician is 5 miles away'). engage accessibility consultant for audit.","Develop a simplified, text-only 'Accessible Mode' view for critical tracking features if the map interface cannot be made compliant.","Accessibility automated audit (Pa11y/Axe) failure count > 0.","Frontend Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-SEC-001","Technical","GDPR compliance failure regarding 'Right to be Forgotten' due to immutable logs or backups containing PII.","3","5","15","High","WI-INF-002 (PostgreSQL Provisioning), WI-PROD-001 (Schema Design)","Storing PII in audit trails or immutable event logs which cannot be deleted selectively.","Implement crypto-shredding: Store PII encrypted with a user-specific key; deleting the key effectively renders the data unreadable/deleted without altering the immutable log structure.","Manual scrub scripts for database backups (high effort/risk).","Security audit finding unencrypted PII in log streams.","Security Architect","2025-02-20","Not Started"

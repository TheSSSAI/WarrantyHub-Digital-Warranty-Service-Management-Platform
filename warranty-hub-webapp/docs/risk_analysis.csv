"RISK-001","Technical","Data consistency and synchronization failures in the 'Offline-First' mobile architecture using WatermelonDB/Realm, specifically regarding service request queueing and conflict resolution during network restoration.","4","5","20","Critical","WI-MOBILE-003 (Implement Offline Queue), US-075 (User Offline Actions)","Complexity of bi-directional synchronization and conflict resolution strategies when multiple devices modify the same dataset or when backend state changes while client is offline.","Implement a 'Last-Write-Wins' conflict resolution policy initially; Utilize a robust sync adapter for WatermelonDB; Enforce strict idempotent API design for all write endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH).","Fallback to 'Online-Only' mode for critical write operations if sync integrity cannot be guaranteed, queuing only read operations.","Sync error rate exceeding 1% in staging environment telemetry.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","Delays in configuring Azure AD B2C Custom Policies for complex requirements (MFA, role claims injection, mobile biometric integration) impacting the critical path for user authentication.","4","4","16","High","WI-AUTH-001, WI-AUTH-002, WI-AUTH-003, US-016, US-080","Steep learning curve of Azure AD B2C Identity Experience Framework (XML configuration) and potential limitations in standard user flows requiring custom development.","Assign a dedicated Identity Specialist; Start B2C configuration immediately (Sprint 0); Utilize standard user flows for MVP if custom policies prove too time-consuming.","Revert to standard OIDC flows without custom claims injection and fetch user profile/roles from the internal database post-login as a temporary workaround.","Failure to complete 'Sign-up/Sign-in' proof of concept by end of Sprint 1.","Security Architect","2025-06-01","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Performance","Technician location updates via WebSockets failing to meet the <2s latency requirement due to network variability, Redis adapter bottlenecks, or mobile background process throttling.","3","4","12","High","WI-REALTIME-001 (Technician Location Gateway), WI-MOBILE-001 (Background Location)","Aggressive OS-level battery optimization killing background location threads on iOS/Android and latency introduced by the Pub/Sub hop through Redis.","Implement client-side throttling (e.g., send updates every 5s instead of 1s); Use `react-native-background-geolocation` with motion-detection to keep service alive; Optimize Redis adapter configuration.","Increase latency tolerance in SLA to 5-10 seconds; Implement 'polling' fallback if WebSocket connection is unstable.","P95 latency metrics for `LocationUpdate` events exceeding 1.5s during load testing.","Backend Lead","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","Cost overruns and rate limiting from third-party APIs (Mapbox for geocoding/routing, Azure AI Document Intelligence for OCR) under high load or denial-of-service conditions.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-CORE-002 (Geospatial Routing), WI-INT-001 (Invoice OCR)","Direct synchronous calls to paid external APIs triggered by user actions without sufficient caching or rate limiting protection.","Implement aggressive caching for Geocoding results; Use a Circuit Breaker pattern (Polly/Opossum) for all external calls; Set strict budget alerts in Azure Cost Management.","Disable OCR 'auto-fill' feature temporarily if quota is exceeded; Fallback to basic postal code matching instead of polygon geocoding.","API usage costs exceeding 80% of monthly budget projection within the first week.","DevOps Engineer","2025-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Distributed transaction failures causing data inconsistency between the Primary Database, Audit Logs (OpenSearch), and Notification Service (Service Bus) during critical state changes.","3","5","15","High","WI-CORE-001 (Service Request State Machine), WI-INT-002 (Audit Logging)","Lack of two-phase commit or transactional outbox pattern when coordinating writes across PostgreSQL and Azure Service Bus/OpenSearch.","Implement the 'Transactional Outbox' pattern: write events to a local DB table within the business transaction, then use a separate worker to push to Service Bus/OpenSearch.","Implement comprehensive reconciliation scripts to identify and fix orphaned or missing audit logs/notifications.","Discrepancy count between 'ServiceRequests' table and 'AuditLogs' index > 0.","Backend Architect","2025-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Complexity of 'Right to be Forgotten' (GDPR) implementation across distributed storage (Postgres, Blob Storage, OpenSearch logs) leading to compliance violations.","2","5","10","Medium","US-118 (Anonymize User Data), WI-INT-002 (Audit Logging)","Immutable nature of Audit Logs and decentralized storage of PII (Invoices in Blob, User data in B2C/Postgres) making complete erasure difficult.","Design PII data mapping early; Implement a 'Crypto-shredding' strategy where PII is encrypted with a user-specific key that can be deleted; Ensure Audit Logs store references, not raw PII.","Manual intervention process for GDPR deletion requests while automation is being refined.","GDPR deletion job failure alerts.","Data Protection Officer / Tech Lead","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","Failure to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards in complex interactive components (Maps, Signature Pads, Real-time Chat) delaying release.","4","3","12","Medium","US-078 (Platform Accessibility), WI-MOBILE-002 (Signature Capture)","Canvas-based elements (Signature Pad) and Map controls are inherently difficult to make accessible to screen readers; Late stage accessibility testing.","Adopt 'Accessibility-First' development; Integrate `axe-core` into CI/CD pipelines (WI-CICD-001); Use native accessible alternatives where canvas isn't strictly necessary.","Provide alternative text-based workflows for map/signature interactions (e.g., text confirmation instead of signature for accessibility mode).","Automated accessibility score < 90% in CI builds.","Frontend Lead","2025-06-30","Monitoring"

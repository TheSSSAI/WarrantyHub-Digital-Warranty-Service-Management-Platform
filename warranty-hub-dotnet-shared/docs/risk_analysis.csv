"RISK-001","Technical","Mobile OS battery optimization and background execution limits (iOS/Android) may aggressively terminate the technician background location tracking service, causing data gaps and failing the <2s latency requirement.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-MOB-T-001","Native mobile operating systems prioritize battery life over background processes, requiring specialized implementation to maintain persistent WebSocket connections or frequent GPS polling.","Implement a robust foreground service for Android and 'Always' location permissions for iOS. Utilize a specialized commercial-grade library (e.g., TransistorSoft) rather than generic open-source plugins. Implement local buffering of coordinates to handle connection drops.","Fallback to SMS-based location pings or server-side polling if WebSocket connection is unstable or terminated by OS.","Technician location update gaps exceeding 60 seconds in staging environments during movement simulation.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Complex PostGIS point-in-polygon queries combined with dynamic service center availability checks may exceed the P95 <250ms latency requirement under high load (10k users).","4","5","20","High","WI-BE-REQ-001","Geospatial queries on complex polygons are computationally expensive, and when combined with real-time logic (availability/round-robin) in a single synchronous transaction, performance degrades.","Implement rigorous spatial indexing (GIST) on PostgreSQL. Cache simplified polygon definitions in Redis for rapid pre-filtering. Offload non-critical routing logic to background workers via Azure Service Bus.","Scale up PostgreSQL SKU or implement read replicas specifically for geospatial read operations.","Routing API endpoint latency exceeds 200ms during load testing of 500 concurrent requests.","Backend Architect","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Offline-first data synchronization conflicts in the User App (WatermelonDB/Realm) may lead to data corruption or loss when syncing warranty/product data back to the server.","4","4","16","High","WI-MOB-U-002","Bi-directional sync logic is inherently complex; concurrent modifications on different devices or server-side updates while a device is offline create collision scenarios.","Adopt a strict 'Last-Write-Wins' policy or 'Server-Authority' model. Implement granular sync endpoints (diffs only). Design API to be idempotent to handle retry storms after network restoration.","Disable offline write capabilities for critical data; limit offline mode to read-only access for cached warranty cards.","Sync error rate exceeds 1% during network interruption simulation tests.","Mobile Developer (User App)","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","Azure AD B2C custom policy configuration for complex multi-role RBAC (Super Admin, Brand Admin, Technician) requires niche XML skills, creating a dependency bottleneck.","3","5","15","High","WI-INFRA-003, WI-BE-AUTH-001","Azure AD B2C Identity Experience Framework (IEF) uses complex XML configuration which is distinct from standard OAuth/OIDC implementation skills common in Node.js teams.","Engage an Identity Specialist consultant for initial setup. Utilize Azure AD B2C Starter Packs. Implement a mock auth service for local development to prevent blocking backend developers.","Simplify RBAC implementation to manage roles within the application database instead of token claims, reducing B2C complexity.","Auth-related tickets blocked for >3 days due to configuration issues.","DevOps Engineer","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Security","User-uploaded invoices (PDF/Images) may contain malware, which could propagate to internal systems or other users if not sanitized immediately upon upload.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-BE-PROD-002","Allowing public file uploads is a primary attack vector. Processing these files (e.g., for OCR or display) executes code that could trigger exploits.","Integrate Azure Defender for Storage (Malware Scanning). quarantine uploaded blobs until scan completes. Use sandboxed parsers for file validation.","Disable instant availability of uploaded documents; enforce a processing delay to allow asynchronous scanning.","Detection of any unscanned file access in Blob Storage logs.","Security Lead","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Kubernetes (AKS) complexity regarding networking (Azure CNI) and Ingress configuration may delay environment readiness and complicate troubleshooting.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-INFRA-001","The requirement for microservices orchestration on AKS introduces significant operational overhead compared to PaaS (App Service), specifically regarding VNet integration and ingress controllers.","Use Terraform modules with proven defaults. Implement GitOps (ArgoCD or Flux) for declarative configuration management. Ensure dev team has 'bridge to kubernetes' or similar local debug tools.","Downgrade non-critical services to Azure Container Apps if AKS management overhead becomes unsustainable.","Infrastructure provisioning time exceeds 4 hours or repeated Terraform apply failures.","Cloud Architect","2025-02-05","Not Started"

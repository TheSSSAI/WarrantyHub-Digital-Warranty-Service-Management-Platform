[{'name': 'API Gateway', 'type': 'Gateway', 'implementation': 'Azure API Management or YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) on .NET 8, deployed on AKS.', 'applicability': 'Acts as the single, unified entry point for all web and mobile client applications. It is essential for routing requests to the appropriate backend microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns like JWT-based authentication and rate limiting, simplifying client logic and securing the internal service landscape.'}, {'name': 'Request-Reply', 'type': 'RequestReply', 'implementation': 'Synchronous HTTP/REST APIs built with ASP.NET Core 8.', 'applicability': 'The primary pattern for all client-to-server interactions that require an immediate response. This includes user actions like registering a product, creating a service request (REQ-FUNC-007), transferring ownership (REQ-FUNC-004), and defining service areas (REQ-FUNC-002).'}, {'name': 'Message Queue', 'type': 'MessageQueue', 'implementation': 'Azure Service Bus Queues for point-to-point, command-based messaging.', 'applicability': 'Essential for offloading long-running, resource-intensive tasks to background workers.

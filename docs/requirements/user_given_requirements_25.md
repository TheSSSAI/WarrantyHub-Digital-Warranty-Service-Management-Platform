### **Project Overview: WarrantyHub Platform**

The system is a comprehensive web and mobile platform designed to centralize product warranty and service management for Indian consumers and brands. It bridges the communication gap between users, service centers, and manufacturers.

### **Core User Features**

-   **Product & Warranty Management**: Users can register their purchased products by entering details like brand, model, serial number, and purchase date. They will manually input the warranty duration (e.g., 12 months) to automatically calculate the expiry date.
-   **Digital Vault**: Each registered product will have a digital warranty card with a color-coded status (Valid/Expired). The platform also serves as a secure digital vault for storing and searching all product invoices.
-   **Service Requests**: Users can raise service requests directly from the app, describing the issue, attaching photos/videos, and suggesting a preferred time for the technician's visit.
-   **Status Tracking & Alerts**: Users receive push notifications and can track the status of their service requests (e.g., Requested, Assigned). They will receive updates on the technician's status, including an "On The Way" notification and an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
-   **Custom Reminders**: The system will send automated reminders for upcoming warranty expirations. Users can also create their own custom, recurring reminders for periodic maintenance like AC servicing or RO filter changes.
-   **Simplified Product Entry**: The mobile app will feature a barcode/QR code scanner to help pre-fill product information like brand and model where available, though users will need to manually enter the unique serial number.

### **Service Center & Technician Features**

-   **Service Ticket Management**: A dedicated panel allows service centers to view all incoming service requests for their assigned brands.
-   **Dispatch & Workflow**: Service centers can assign requests to specific technicians, who can then view their assigned jobs.
-   **Job Updates**: Technicians and service centers can update service notes, track the parts used, and update the job status, culminating in closing the ticket upon resolution.

### **Brand Administrator Features**

-   **Centralized Dashboard**: Brands get access to a backend dashboard providing high-level analytics.
-   **Key Metrics**: The dashboard will display data on total registered products, the number of active warranties, ongoing service requests, and common fault patterns reported by users.
-   **Reporting**: Brands can export this data in CSV/PDF format for internal analysis and reporting.
-   **Warranty Verification**: The platform facilitates the verification of warranty claims, allowing brand admins or service centers to approve or reject claims based on system data.

### **System-Wide & Security Features**

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system will enforce strict permissions for each role: User, Service Center, Technician, and Brand Admin.
-   **Secure Access**: User authentication will be secured with OTP-based login mechanisms.
-   **Data Protection**: All sensitive user and product data will be protected using standard data encryption protocols.

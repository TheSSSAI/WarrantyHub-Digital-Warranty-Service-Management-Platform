This diagram illustrates the NoSQL document structure for a chat conversation. Since it's a document database model (Cosmos DB with MongoDB API), the entire conversation, including all participants and messages, is stored as a single 'ChatConversation' document. This design optimizes for read performance by retrieving a full conversation in one operation. There are no relational links to other entities in this specific schema view.

"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Mobile background location tracking (Travel Mode) is highly susceptible to OS-level battery optimization aggression, leading to terminated processes and gaps in technician tracking data.","5","4","20","Critical","WI-TECH-001, WI-SERV-002, US-079","iOS and Android aggressively kill background processes consuming GPS to preserve battery; strict permission requirements for 'Always On' location.","Implement a robust background-fetch library (e.g., react-native-background-geolocation) with motion-change detection to reduce polling frequency when stationary. Implement local SQLite queueing for coordinates when the network is unreachable.","Fallback to 'significant location change' updates only (lower fidelity) or require the app to be in the foreground during active travel.","Technician device heartbeat loss > 5 minutes while 'Travel Mode' is active.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-RES-002","Resource","Complexity of Azure AD B2C Custom Policies (XML/IEF) requires niche expertise, creating a single-point-of-failure dependency and potential delays in Auth flows.","4","5","20","High","WI-IAM-001, WI-IAM-002, US-016, US-082","Identity Experience Framework (IEF) uses complex XML configuration that is difficult to debug and distinct from standard OAuth implementation skills.","Engage an Azure Identity specialist consultant for initial setup. Utilize the 'Azure AD B2C Starter Pack' repositories. Implement automated B2C policy deployment via CI/CD to prevent manual errors.","Revert to standard User Flows (non-custom) which reduces UI customization capabilities but guarantees core functionality.","Auth configuration tasks exceeding estimated effort by >20%.","Security Architect","2025-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-TECH-003","Technical","Data consistency issues between the transactional database (PostgreSQL) and the search/analytics engine (OpenSearch) due to eventual consistency latency in the event-driven architecture.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-SEARCH-001, WI-SERV-001, US-092","Decoupled microservices architecture relying on Azure Service Bus for data synchronization introduces lag and potential message failure scenarios.","Implement the Transactional Outbox Pattern to ensure events are never lost even if the broker is down. Implement idempotent consumers in the Search service.","Implement a nightly full-reindex batch job to repair data drift between Postgres and OpenSearch.","Lag between 'ProductCreated' event timestamp and OpenSearch document indexing > 10 seconds.","Backend Lead","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-EXT-004","External","Azure AI Document Intelligence (OCR) latency or failure rates for invoice processing may degrade user experience during product registration.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-PROD-002, US-018, US-019","Dependency on external API performance and the variability of user-uploaded image quality (blur, lighting, handwriting).","Process OCR asynchronously: Return '202 Accepted' immediately to UI, process in background, and push notification/websocket update upon completion. Implement Client-side image pre-processing/compression.","Provide a manual data entry fallback workflow if OCR fails or times out after 15 seconds.","OCR API P95 latency exceeding 5 seconds or failure rate > 5%.","Backend Developer","2025-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-OPS-005","Operational","AKS Networking complexity with Azure CNI and VNet integration may lead to IP address exhaustion or connectivity issues between pods and managed services.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-INFRA-001, WI-INFRA-002","Azure CNI assigns an IP address from the VNet to every Pod, requiring rigorous subnet planning for scaling to 10,000 concurrent users.","Utilize Azure CNI Overlay or Kubenet if IP conservation is critical, or pre-allocate a significantly large CIDR block (/16) for the AKS subnet. Use Terraform `cidrsubnet` functions for precise calculation.","Re-provision cluster networking using Azure CNI Overlay networking mode to decouple Pod IPs from VNet IPs.","Subnet IP usage exceeding 70% capacity.","DevOps Engineer","2025-05-30","In Progress"
"RISK-QUAL-006","Quality","Offline data synchronization conflicts in the mobile app may result in data loss or corruption when technicians work in low-connectivity areas.","4","4","16","High","WI-TECH-001, US-075","Technicians modifying job status or notes locally while the server state changes (e.g., dispatch reassignment) creates 'last write wins' conflicts.","Implement a local queue (WatermelonDB/RxDB) with operation logs. Use a 'conflict resolution strategy' where server state is fetched before pushing local updates.","Implement a manual 'Resolve Conflict' UI for technicians to choose which version of data to keep.","Sync error rate > 1% in mobile application logs.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-TECH-007","Technical","WebSocket Gateway scalability bottleneck under load (10k concurrent users) causing delays in real-time chat and location updates.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-CHAT-001, US-041, US-097","Stateful WebSocket connections on AKS pods require sticky sessions or a Redis adapter for broadcasting across multiple pods.","Configure the NestJS WebSocket Gateway with the Redis IoAdapter for horizontal scaling. Use Azure SignalR Service as a fully managed alternative to offload connection management.","Migrate from self-hosted Socket.io on AKS to managed Azure Web PubSub or SignalR Service.","WebSocket connection establishment latency > 500ms or drop rate > 0.5%.","Backend Architect","2025-06-30","Not Started"

"RISK-TEC-001","Technical","Offline data synchronization conflicts using WatermelonDB in React Native apps may lead to data corruption or loss when technicians sync job statuses after extended offline periods.","4","5","20","High","WI-MOB-001: Offline-First Data Sync","Complex conflict resolution logic required when multiple clients or the server update the same record (e.g., job status) simultaneously during network partitions.","Implement a strict 'Server-Wins' conflict resolution policy for critical status updates and a 'Last-Write-Wins' for isolated notes. Design idempotent API endpoints.","Implement a manual conflict resolution UI for technicians to review and merge data discrepancies if automated sync fails.","Sync error rates exceeding 1% in application logs or 'Data Consistency' alerts from the backend.","Mobile Engineering Lead","2023-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-TEC-002","Technical","Mobile OS (iOS/Android) aggressively killing background location processes for 'Travel Mode', preventing real-time tracking updates to the customer.","5","4","20","High","WI-MOB-002: Technician Travel Mode & Background Location","Strict battery optimization and privacy policies in modern mobile operating systems that restrict long-running background tasks.","Implement platform-specific foreground services (Android) and 'Always Allow' location permission flows (iOS). Implement batched updates to reduce wake-ups.","Fallback to 'Significant Location Change' service which is less accurate but more battery efficient and less likely to be killed.","Gaps in GPS telemetry data > 5 minutes for active 'Travel Mode' sessions.","Mobile Engineering Lead","2023-11-20","In Progress"
"RISK-PERF-001","Quality","Failure to meet the < 250ms P95 API latency requirement due to overhead from inter-service communication (NestJS to .NET workers) and database locking.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-BE-001, WI-BE-002","Synchronous calls between microservices, unoptimized database queries, or lack of caching for static data like Product Models.","Implement aggressive Redis caching for read-heavy data. Use Azure Service Bus for asynchronous processing of non-blocking write operations.","Scale up database DTUs or vertically scale AKS nodes. Refactor critical paths to use read-replicas.","P95 latency metrics in Azure Monitor exceeding 200ms threshold during load testing.","Backend Architect","2023-12-01","Not Started"

"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Technician mobile application background location services may be terminated by Android/iOS operating systems due to battery optimization protocols, causing gaps in real-time tracking and SLA failures.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-APP-002 (Implement Technician 'Travel Mode'), WI-SERV-004 (Technician Real-time Location Tracking)","Aggressive OS-level battery saving heuristics and permission revocations for background processes in modern mobile operating systems.","Implement a robust foreground service for Android and 'Always' location permission handling for iOS. Utilize specialized libraries like `react-native-background-geolocation` that handle OS-specific keep-alive signals and motion detection to throttle updates when stationary.","Implement a 'heartbeat' monitor on the backend; if location stops while job is 'In Progress', send push notification to technician to bring app to foreground. Fallback to last known location with timestamp on user map.","Technician location update latency exceeds 60 seconds during active 'Travel Mode' for >5% of active sessions.","Mobile Lead Developer","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-SEC-002","Technical","Misconfiguration of Azure AD B2C custom policies and claim mapping could lead to privilege escalation or broken authentication flows across the diverse user roles (Super Admin, Brand Admin, Tech, User).","3","5","15","High","WI-AUTH-001 (Implement Azure AD B2C Integration), WI-AUTH-002 (User Registration API)","Complexity of XML-based Identity Experience Framework policies and mismatch between B2C tokens and NestJS Guard expectations.","Implement automated integration tests specifically for token claim validation for every role type. Treat B2C policies as code with strict version control and peer review. Use 'User Flows' where possible before resorting to 'Custom Policies' to reduce complexity.","Implement a 'kill switch' to revert to a maintenance mode or fallback authentication provider if B2C becomes compromised or unstable.","Authentication failure rate > 1% or detection of tokens with conflicting role claims.","Security Architect","2025-06-01","In Progress"
"RISK-DATA-003","Quality","Data consistency conflicts arising from the 'Offline-First' architecture in the Technician App when syncing queued status updates and notes back to the server after connectivity restoration.","4","4","16","High","WI-APP-003 (Implement Offline Sync), WI-SERV-002 (Service Request State Machine)","Technicians operating in low-connectivity zones modifying state that may have changed on the server (e.g., job reassignment) during the disconnect.","Implement a rigid conflict resolution strategy (e.g., 'Server Wins' for status, 'Merge' for notes). Use timestamp-based versioning for all entities. Ensure API endpoints are idempotent.","Create a 'Sync Conflict' UI in the mobile app to prompt the technician to manually resolve data discrepancies if automatic resolution fails.","Sync error rate > 2% of total sync attempts recorded in Application Insights.","Backend Lead","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-EXT-004","External","Azure AI Document Intelligence (OCR) may have low accuracy rates for non-standardized or poor-quality invoice images, leading to high user friction during product registration.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-PROD-001 (Implement Invoice OCR Processing Pipeline)","Variability in invoice formats, lighting conditions, and handwriting on receipts uploaded by users.","Implement a 'Human-in-the-loop' validation UI where the user confirms/edits extracted data before submission. Configure the OCR service to return confidence scores and trigger manual review or prompt for re-upload if score < 75%.","Provide a seamless 'Skip OCR / Manual Entry' workflow that is easily accessible if image upload takes > 10 seconds or fails.","Average OCR confidence score drops below 80% or 'Manual Entry' fallback rate exceeds 30%.","Product Owner","2025-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-PERF-005","Technical","Geospatial queries for service routing (PostGIS) combined with real-time location updates may degrade database performance under heavy load (10k concurrent users).","3","4","12","Medium","WI-SERV-001 (Geospatial Service Routing), WI-SERV-004 (Location Tracking)","Resource-intensive `ST_Contains` and `ST_DWithin` queries running on the main transactional database instance.","Implement Read Replicas for the PostgreSQL database specifically for analytics and routing queries. Use Redis to cache the 'Technician Location' for the websocket stream, persisting to PostGIS/TimescaleDB only for audit history asynchronously.","Scale up the Azure Database for PostgreSQL tier or implement a queue-based routing mechanism where routing happens asynchronously rather than in real-time.","Database CPU usage > 70% or average query time for routing > 300ms.","Database Reliability Engineer","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-OPS-006","Operational","Deployment failure or infrastructure drift due to circular dependencies in Terraform modules (e.g., AKS requiring VNet, VNet requiring DB private link configuration).","3","4","12","Medium","WI-INFRA-001 (Provision AKS), WI-INFRA-002 (Provision PostgreSQL)","Tight coupling of infrastructure components and lack of layered state management in Terraform.","Adopt a layered Terraform architecture (Network Layer -> Data Layer -> App Layer) with separate state files. Use `terragrunt` or scripts to orchestrate dependencies.","Maintain manual deployment runbooks for disaster recovery if IaC pipeline fails critically.","Terraform plan/apply failure rate > 0 in master branch pipeline.","DevOps Engineer","2025-05-30","In Progress"

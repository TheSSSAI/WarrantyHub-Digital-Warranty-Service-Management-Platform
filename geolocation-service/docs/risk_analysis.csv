"RISK-001","Technical","Mobile offline data synchronization logic using local databases (SQLite/WatermelonDB) may encounter severe data consistency conflicts and race conditions upon network restoration, jeopardizing the integrity of service requests.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-MOB-001 (Offline Sync Logic), WI-PROD-001 (Registration API)","Complexity of bi-directional sync, conflict resolution strategies in distributed systems, and handling partial uploads during intermittent connectivity.","Implement 'Last-Write-Wins' strategy for simple fields and operational transformation or differential syncing for complex objects. Utilize WatermelonDB's built-in sync adapter. Design idempotent backend APIs to handle duplicate replay requests safely.","Implement a 'Force Fetch' fallback that prompts users to resolve conflicts manually via UI if automated resolution fails.","Sync error rate exceeding 1% in mobile app telemetry logs; detection of duplicate transaction IDs in backend.","Lead Mobile Engineer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","Apple App Store and Google Play Store may reject the technician application due to stringent background location permission requirements if battery optimization and usage transparency are not proven adequate.","4","5","20","Critical","WI-MOB-002 (Background Location), WI-RT-002 (Location Streaming)","Platform providers (Apple/Google) aggressively restrict 'Always On' background location access to preserve battery life and user privacy.","Implement 'While Using' permission logic where possible; utilize 'foreground service' notifications on Android. Create detailed usage description strings in Info.plist. Implement logic to stop tracking immediately upon job completion.","Fallback to 'pings' at specific intervals (e.g., every 5 mins) rather than real-time streaming if stores reject continuous background tracking.","App Store rejection notification or Beta tester reports of excessive battery drain (>15% per hour).","Product Owner / Mobile Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Performance","Real-time technician location tracking via WebSockets may fail to meet the <2s latency requirement under high load due to bottlenecks in the Redis Pub/Sub adapter or NestJS Gateway scaling limits.","3","5","15","High","WI-RT-001 (WebSocket Gateway), WI-RT-002 (Location Streaming)","High volume of location emission events (e.g., 1 per second per technician) overwhelming the message broker or event loop.","Implement throttling at the mobile client level (e.g., only send update if moved > 20 meters). Use distinct Redis instances for Pub/Sub vs. Caching. Configure horizontal autoscaling (HPA) for WebSocket gateway pods.","Degrade service level to polling mechanism (pull based) at 10-second intervals for location updates if WebSocket infrastructure buckles.","WebSocket message latency > 1.5s; CPU throttling on Gateway pods.","Backend Architect","2025-02-28","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Resource","Configuration of Azure AD B2C custom policies for complex multi-persona (Consumer, Tech, Admin) authentication flows may exceed team capability, causing delays in securing API endpoints.","4","4","16","High","WI-AUTH-001 (Azure AD Strategy), WI-WEB-001 (Next.js Auth)","Azure AD B2C custom policies utilize XML-based configuration (Identity Experience Framework) which has a steep learning curve and limited debugging tools.","Engage an Azure Identity consultant for initial setup review. Utilize standard User Flows where possible before dropping down to Custom Policies. Implement strict integration tests early.","Simplify auth requirements for MVP (e.g., remove complex custom claims mapping) or switch to a managed auth provider wrapper like Auth0 if B2C proves unmanageable.","Authentication integration tasks slipping schedule by > 3 days.","DevOps Engineer","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","GDPR 'Right to be Forgotten' compliance is jeopardized by immutable audit logs and distributed data storage (Backups, Event Bus, Redis), leading to potential regulatory fines.","2","5","10","Medium","Cross-Cutting Security Requirements, WI-PROD-001 (Product Entity)","Conflict between the requirement for 'Immutable Audit Logs' and the legal requirement to delete PII upon request.","Design audit logs to store PII references (User IDs) rather than raw PII. When a user requests deletion, scrub the User table, effectively anonymizing the immutable logs. Implement crypto-shredding for backup archives.","Manual intervention process for Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR) if automated anonymization fails.","Security audit identifying raw PII in log streams (Application Insights).","Data Protection Officer / Architect","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","PostGIS spatial queries for technician routing may cause database CPU spikes, violating the P95 < 250ms latency requirement as the dataset of service requests and service areas grows.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-SR-002 (Geospatial Routing), WI-INFRA-002 (PostgreSQL Setup)","Complex spatial joins (ST_Contains, ST_DWithin) are computationally expensive without proper spatial indexing and tuning.","Ensure GiST indexes are applied to all geometry columns. Offload read-heavy spatial analytics to read replicas. Pre-calculate service area assignments asynchronously where possible.","Scale up Azure PostgreSQL SKU (vCore count) temporarily while optimizing query plans.","Database CPU utilization > 70% or Slow Query Logs showing spatial queries > 100ms.","Database Administrator / Backend Dev","2025-03-10","Not Started"

"RISK-TECH-001","Technical","Latency threshold breach (<2s) for real-time technician tracking due to WebSocket connection instability on mobile networks and Redis adapter serialization overhead.","4","5","20","High","WI-RT-002, WI-MOB-001","Reliance on continuous WebSocket streams over volatile cellular networks combined with heavy JSON serialization in Redis adapter for broadcasting.","Implement adaptive throttling on the mobile client (send updates based on distance delta rather than strict time intervals). Optimize Redis Adapter configuration for binary message formats.","Fallback to polling mechanism (every 15s) if WebSocket connection health degrades below acceptable thresholds.","WebSocket heartbeat failure rate > 5% or P95 message propagation latency > 1.5s.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-06-15","In Progress"
"RISK-EXT-001","External","iOS App Store rejection due to strict scrutiny of 'Background Location' permissions and potential battery drainage issues.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-MOB-001","Aggressive background GPS tracking requirements for technician app conflict with Apple's strict battery and privacy guidelines.","Implement 'Significant Location Change' API when stationary. Ensure UI explicitly indicates when tracking is active. Prepare detailed App Store Review explanation and video demo.","Refactor tracking to 'While Using' permission only, requiring the app to be foregrounded during active travel, or use push-to-track manual updates.","Technician device battery drain > 15% per hour during testing.","Mobile Tech Lead","2025-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-DATA-001","Technical","Data consistency conflicts during offline-to-online synchronization of service requests from the Technician Mobile App.","4","4","16","High","WI-MOB-003","Distributed state modifications where server-side data changes (e.g., ticket reassignment) clash with local offline updates.","Implement a 'Last-Write-Wins' strategy for non-critical fields and a user-intervention queue for status conflicts. Use WatermelonDB for robust sync protocol.","Disable offline write capabilities for critical status changes, restricting offline mode to 'Read-Only' for complex entities.","Sync error rate > 1% in telemetry logs.","Senior Full-Stack Developer","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-PERF-001","Technical","PostGIS spatial query performance degradation ('ST_Contains') under load during service center routing assignments.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-BE-004","Complex polygon geometries for service centers and lack of proper spatial indexing on high-volume concurrent requests.","Enforce GIST indexing on geometry columns. Implement Redis caching for service center polygon definitions to reduce DB hits. Simplify polygon vertices.","Offload geospatial calculation to a specialized microservice or Azure Maps API (increase cost but guaranteed performance).","Database CPU utilization > 70% during load tests.","Database Architect","2025-06-20","In Progress"
"RISK-INT-001","Technical","Azure AD B2C custom policy complexity leading to authentication delays and integration bottlenecks.","3","5","15","High","WI-BE-001","High complexity of XML-based Identity Experience Framework (IEF) for custom role injection into JWTs.","Utilize API Connectors to inject claims via NestJS webhooks rather than complex XML transformations. Establish a separate B2C dev tenant immediately.","Fallback to standard User Flows and perform a secondary DB lookup for roles in the NestJS AuthGuard (trade-off: slightly higher latency).","Authentication token issuance latency > 500ms.","Security Engineer","2025-05-30","In Progress"
"RISK-OP-001","Operational","RTO breach (4 hours) due to complex state recovery across microservices, Redis, and PostGIS in a disaster scenario.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-INFRA-002","Dependency on multiple stateful services (Postgres, Redis, Blob) requiring synchronized restoration to maintain referential integrity.","Implement Terraform-based automated disaster recovery drills. Enable Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) and Azure Backup cross-region restore.","Manual failover runbook execution if automated terraform apply fails in secondary region.","Backup restoration drill time exceeding 3 hours.","DevOps Lead","2025-08-01","Not Started"
